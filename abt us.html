     <p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 40px;">  The narrative we're about to share occurs in 2018, on the Tondo neighborhood of Asuncion, where our shop is located. We provide our guests with freshly ground coffee, tea, meals, and sweets. What was once a corporate employee's fantasy is now a reality for us. We work hard to uphold the greatest standards of quality and service, fusing innovation with tradition to provide our customers with one-of-a-kind experiences. Every coffee cup we offer has a backstory.
